<h1>
 Overall Project Aim:
</h1>
<p>
To develop interpretable and population-aware AI/ML models using multi-omics data for early risk prediction, subtype stratification, and biomarker discovery in breast cancer.
Entire project will be completed in 6 seperate steps/tasks. 
</p>

<h2> Task 1: Risk Prediction Using AI on Multi-Omics Data </h2>
<br>

<ul>
Objective: Predict early-stage breast cancer risk using genomics, transcriptomics, and methylation profiles.
</ul><br><ul>
Approach: Compare classical models (logistic regression) with ensemble models (RF, XGBoost) and DL architectures (autoencoders, multimodal DNNs).
</ul><br>
<ul>
Deliverable: Publication on "Multi-omics AI model for early breast cancer risk prediction."
</ul>
