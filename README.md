# Breast-Cancer-AI
<br><br>

<h2>
 Overall Project Aim:
</h2>
<p>
To develop interpretable and population-aware AI/ML models using multi-omics data for early risk prediction, subtype stratification, and biomarker discovery in breast cancer.
Entire project will be completed in 6 seperate steps/tasks. 
</p>

<h3> Task 1: Risk Prediction Using AI on Multi-Omics Data </h3>
<br>

<ul>
<li>
Objective: Predict early-stage breast cancer risk using genomics, transcriptomics, and methylation profiles.</li>
</ul><br><ul>
<li>
Approach: Compare classical models (logistic regression) with ensemble models (RF, XGBoost) and DL architectures (autoencoders, multimodal DNNs).</li>
</ul><br>
<ul><li>
Deliverable: Publication on "Multi-omics AI model for early breast cancer risk prediction." </li>
</ul>
